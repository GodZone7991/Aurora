It is a fan project that recuts the One Piece anime to match the pacing of the original manga. They remove filler scenes and ensure seamless editing and quality control. The company has a website where users can watch and download episodes. They are also looking for contributors such as translators, quality checkers, timers, web developers, and illustrators. The website was remade in 2019 to better support the international community and has plans for further development. One Pace is 45% faster to watch compared to the original anime."
